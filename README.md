# Predicting_Stock_Market_Using_MCMC
Using historical share price data from 2000 to the present, we apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to predict the percentage change in share price for the upcoming year. The model also provides annual predicted versus actual growth statistics to assess the stock's historical performance and the predictive accuracy of the simulation.
